    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This chicken enchilada recipe is made with fresh green salsa, just like
      you would find in a Mexican restaurant or better yet, in a Mexican home.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>¼ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon taco seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups enchilada sauce</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons chili powder</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>8 flour tortillas</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef
        and onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7
        minutes. Drain and discard grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir 1 cup Cheddar cheese, sour cream, parsley, taco seasoning, oregano,
        and black pepper into ground beef until cheese is melted. Mix in
        enchilada sauce, chili powder, garlic, and salt; bring to a boil, reduce
        heat to low, and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spoon about 1/4 cup meat sauce
        down the center of tortilla. Top meat sauce with 1 tablespoon black
        beans and a sprinkling of black olives. Roll up tortilla, enclosing
        filling; lay seam-side down in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with
        remaining tortillas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon any remaining meat sauce over rolled tortillas. Scatter any
        remaining black beans and black olives over the top. Sprinkle with
        remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling,
        20 to 22 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
