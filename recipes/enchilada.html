    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This chicken enchilada recipe is made with fresh green salsa, just like
      you would find in a Mexican restaurant or better yet, in a Mexican home.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 bone-in chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>½ white onion, halved, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, divided</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh tomatillos, husks removed</li>
      <li>5 serrano peppers</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
      <li>1 cup crumbled queso fresco</li>
      <li>½ white onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine chicken, broth, one quarter onion, salt, and 1 clove garlic in a
        medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook until chicken is no longer pink
        in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a large bowl to cool.
        Reserve broth; discard onion and garlic. When cool enough to handle,
        shred chicken with your hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place tomatillos and serrano peppers in a medium pot and cover with
        water. Bring to a boil and cook until tomatillos turn from bright green
        to dull, army green. Strain tomatillos and peppers and place in a
        blender. Add remaining one quarter onion, remaining 1 clove garlic, and
        a pinch of salt. Pour in enough reserved broth to cover vegetables in
        the blender by about 1 inch. Blend until completely puréed. Pour salsa
        into a medium saucepan and bring to a low boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat until very hot.
        Lightly fry tortillas, one at time, in hot oil. Remove to paper towels
        to drain
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip tortillas in low-boiling salsa until they become soft again. Place
        onto plates, 3 per person. Fill or cover tortillas with shredded
        chicken, then top with salsa. Sprinkle with queso fresco, onion, and
        cilantr
